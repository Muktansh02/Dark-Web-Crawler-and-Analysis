# Dark-Web-Crawler-and-Analysis

This project presents an automated Dark Web monitoring system designed to detect potential cybersecurity threats using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

**Key Features**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously scans Dark Web forums and marketplaces for relevant discussions.
* **Advanced NLP Analysis:** Employs sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and topic modeling to extract insights from collected data.
* **Data Visualization:** Presents processed information using interactive dashboards for clear threat understanding.
* **Focus on Security (**_Ethical Considerations_**):**
    - This project does NOT provide instructions or tools for accessing the Dark Web.
    - It emphasizes the importance of responsible use and adherence to ethical guidelines.

**Project Goals**

* Develop a system to proactively identify potential cyberattacks and vulnerabilities.
* Empower cybersecurity professionals with actionable insights from Dark Web data.
* Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the cybersecurity community.

**Technical Stack (Replace with specific technologies used)**

* Web Scraping (e.g., Beautiful Soup)
* Natural Language Processing (e.g., spaCy, NLTK)
* Data Analysis and Visualization Libraries (e.g., pandas, Matplotlib)
* Programming Language (e.g., Python)
